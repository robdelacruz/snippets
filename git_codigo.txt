Rob, If you encounter another sync issue, try this guide. 

# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature master
# Edit files
git commit -a -m "Start developing a feature"
In the middle of your feature, we realize there’s a bug in your project
# Create a bug branch based off of master
git checkout -b bug master
# Edit files
git commit -a -m "Fix bug"
# Merge back into master
git checkout master
git merge bug
git branch -d bug
After merging the bug into master, we have a forked project history. Instead of a plain git merge, we’ll integrate the feature branch with a rebase to maintain a linear history
git checkout new-feature
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
